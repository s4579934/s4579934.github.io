Hi everyone!

I'm currently running a dog or cat identifier that I've created from editing the given "bird or not" file.

Same as post 1, now just looking for a cat.

I'll update this post with results below:

I've edited the following code from : /workspaces/course22/00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb

is_dog,_,probs_dog = learn.predict(PILImage.create("cat.jpg"))
if probs_dog[1] >= 0.9:
    print(f"This is a: {is_dog}.")
else:
    print(f"This is a: cat.")
print(f"Probability it's a cat: {probs_dog[0]:.4f}")
Image.open("cat.jpg").to_thumb(256,256)

With the output being:

This is a: cat.
Probability it's a cat: 1.0000

![cat](../images/cat.jpg)
